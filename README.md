This is an Online registration application.

## Requirements

This application requires installation of NodeJS and MongoDB prior to running.

## Description

This application was created to highlight common methods used in MEAN Stack.

## Installation

- Install all dependencies in package.json file. This can be done by navigating to the root directory in the command prompt/terminal/console (I will refer to it as command prompt) and running the following command:

```
$ npm install
```

- You must enter your own MongoDB configuration settings in the server.js file:

```
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost', function(err) {
    if (err) {
        console.log('Not connected to the database: ' + err);
    } else {
        console.log('Successfully connected to MongoDB');
    }
});
```

- You must enter your own Facebook, Twitter, and Google passport.js configuration settings in /app/passport/passport.js:

``` 
passport.use(new FacebookStrategy({
        clientID: '', // Replace with your Facebook Developer App client ID
        clientSecret: '', // Replace with your Facebook Developer client secret
        callbackURL: "", // Replace with your Facebook Developer App callback URL
        profileFields: ['id', 'displayName', 'photos', 'email']
    }
```

```
passport.use(new TwitterStrategy({
        consumerKey: '', // Replace with your Twitter Developer App consumer key
        consumerSecret: '', // Replace with your Twitter Developer App consumer secret
        callbackURL: "", // Replace with your Twitter Developer App callback URL
        userProfileURL: "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/verify_credentials.json?include_email=true"
    }
```

```
passport.use(new GoogleStrategy({
        clientID: '', // Replace with your Google Developer App client ID
        clientSecret: '', // Replace with your Google Developer App client ID
        callbackURL: "" // Replace with your Google Developer App callback URL
    }

```

- Installation is complete. Navigate to folder where server.js file is located and enter the following into command prompt:

```

```
